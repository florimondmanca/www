**Welcome to CodeSail!** My name is Florimond. I will be your captain for this **journey through web development and software engineering.** 👨‍✈️

## A quick bio

I am a Belgian and French young man, born in Belgium and deep-rooted in the European continent.

My journey began about 5 years ago. My very first encounter with programming was in first year after high school, after I obtained the _Baccalauréat_. I was introduced to algorithms and computer science through Python (and fell in love with the language 🐍).

Since 2015, I have been studying a [CentraleSupélec](http://www.centralesupelec.fr/en), in France. My curriculum is a fine mix of "hard sciences" and general engineering with a strong focus on business value and social impact. The school has a humanistic culture that I adhere to as well.

Over the years, my interest in Computer Science, Software Engineering and more lately Web Development has grown continuously. So much so that I decided to specialize in IT and Computer Science for my final year before graduating.

This decision was greatly influenced by the fantastic internship I am currently pursuing at [ComplyAdvantage](https://complyadvantage.com), a RegTech startup that aims at becoming the world-leading, go-to risk data platform — nothing less. For the past few months, I've been able to work with talented engineers on challenging problems involving full-stack web development and microservices at scale.

If you want to know more about my background, you can check out the [About](https://www.florimondmanca.com/about) page or visit me over [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/florimondmanca).

But enough about me! What is this website, and what's in it for you?

## What is CodeSail?

I am convinced that **as a society, we can grow together by learning from one another.** I love reading great content and thought I could contribute myself as well.

As a result, CodeSail was born in late June 2018. It is still very much a **work in progress**. I don't have a logo for this blog (yet! 🧐) and I still have to setup a newsletter so that you can keep an eye on this journey of mine.

However, **the goal of CodeSail is to share ideas, insights and learnings about web development and software engineering with you**.

I will draw most of the content **from my own experience**, which I hope will make it unique and interesting. Types of contents can include:

- Practical code tips or techniques
- How-to guides
- Discussions about an ecosystem, a language or a tool I use
- "Problem solving experience reports", i.e. how I solved a specific problem I encountered

…And many more items, including off-topic wanders of the mind if I think they might be interesting to some of you!

On the technical side, I am primarily working in **Python** and **Javascript**, so they will probably be the languages you'll hear the most about.

If you're not big on these languages — fear not! Besides application development, **there are many exciting language-agnostic topics to write about** such as deployment, CI/CD, documentation, testing and many more.

I will try to commit to a **bi-weekly publication basis**. I believe two posts per week is a good balance between depth of thought and keeping time for my other activities.

Lastly, this project is **an experiment**. I have never done blogging before — nor really engaged in any kind of writing for that matter.

I hope it will be an enriching and humbling experience and I expect to learn a lot in the process. They say that "teaching is the best way to learn". Not that I have the ambition to _teach_ you anything — but I hope you'll be able to learn some interesting things while reading CodeSail!

## Set the sails, weigh the anchor! 🛥

I already have tons of ideas of blog posts to write about. I'm really excited and looking forward to sharing my writings with you!

If you have any feedback or want to get in touch, feel free to do so via social media.

Until then, happy reading! 💻
