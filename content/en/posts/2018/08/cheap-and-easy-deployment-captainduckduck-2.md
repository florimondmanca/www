Welcome back to this two-part article about **CaptainDuckDuck**! In this second and last part, I will take you through the process of **how I deployed my own PaaS using CaptainDuckDuck** to host this personal website and blog. Sounds hard? Actually, not so much!

If you missed on [Part 1](https://blog.florimondmanca.com/cheap-and-easy-deployment-captainduckduck-1), be sure to check it out before reading on. Let's get started!

_**Disclaimer**: I have no personal interest whatsoever in the brands and businesses mentioned in this article, namely OVH, Heroku and DigitalOcean. They are only mentioned for the sake of illustration._

## Refresher

As a quick reminder, **CaptainDuckDuck is an open source system that allows you to run your own Heroku-like PaaS**. It takes advantage of standard tools such as Let's Encrypt, Nginx and Docker to **relieve the pains of deployment**.

Here's what we'll cover:

- Getting a server and a domain name
- Installing and launching CaptainDuckDuck
- Managing apps in the web interface

Ready? Let's get down to business!

## Get a server and a domain name

Although CaptainDuckDuck can run locally if you do some extra configuration, it's primarily meant for production, which means you need a server to run it on.

Also, because CaptainDuckDuck routes your apps on subdomains (e.g. `blog.mydomain.com` or `api.mydomain.com`), you'll also need to own a domain name and attach it to your server.

Even though you have to purchase these, fortunately **a server and a domain name is all you'll need to run your apps with CaptainDuckDuck**.

Let's start with the domain name. I bought one for 10‚Ç¨/year at [OVH](https://www.ovh.com). It's not the most elaborate provider out there, but OVH's domains are simple, functional and reliable.

As for the web server, I obviously chose to go for **the Cloud**. And, well‚Ä¶ there are many cloud providers out there. I decided to go with DigitalOcean's droplets\*. I bought a 1GB RAM server for just \$5/month (50‚Ç¨/year), which turned out to be just enough to run my two apps, a Postgres database and all of CaptainDuckDuck's machinery.

In the end, I get away with a 60‚Ç¨/year setup, which fits my budget and [cuts my costs 4X compared to deploying on Heroku](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-i-cut-my-heroku-cost-by-400-5b9d0220ce13). üí∂

\*_Interestingly enough, [CaptainDuckDuck's documentation](https://captainduckduck.com/docs/server-purchase.html) also mentions DigitalOcean. Be sure to check the docs out for optimal instructions about setting up your droplet to host CaptainDuckDuck if you choose this provider._

Now that we have a server (and figured out the details to connect to it via SSH ‚Äî which very much depends on your provider), let's **install CaptainDuckDuck** on it.

## Install CaptainDuckDuck

The CaptainDuckDuck official [Getting Started](https://captainduckduck.com/docs/get-started.html) guide actually contains all the information you need to install CaptainDuckDuck on your server. Be sure to check it out; I will just say a few things about it here.

To me, CaptainDuckDuck's philosophy boils down to: "no bullsh\*t". However, there are some rather manual steps needed to initiate the CaptainDuckDuck installation. The very first step is to **start CaptainDuckDuck's Docker container**:

```sh
mkdir /captain && docker run -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -p 3000:3000 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock dockersaturn/captainduckduck
```

The next step is to **configure your DNS provider**. As per the docs, your wild-carded root domain needs to point to your server. On my side, I went on my domain's DNS configuration on OVH and created a new `A` record to point `*.florimondmanca.com.` to my server's IP address.

When this is done, we're back to the land of easy-peasy (phew!). CaptainDuckDuck has **a very pragmatic CLI** to help you finish the installation process. Let's install the CLI:

```sh
$ npm install -g captainduckduck
```

Yep ‚Äî that `npm` is the Node.js package manager! CaptainDuckDuck is actually primarily written in server-side Javascript (a.k.a. Node.js), as shown on CaptainDuckDuck's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/githubsaturn/captainduckduck).

![CaptainDuckDuck is 80% Javascript! (And the rest is the docs' HTML.)](/static/img/captainduckduck-languages.png)

Now that the CLI is installed, we can finish up the setup using the properly called `serversetup` command. Let's see what it looks like:

```sh
$ captainduckduck serversetup
Setup your Captain server

? Have you already installed Captain on your server by running the following line:
mkdir /captain && docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock dockersaturn/captainduckduck ? (Use arrow keys)
‚ùØ Yes
  No
```

Yep, I've already done it. What's next?

```sh
? Enter IP address of your captain server: (123.123.123.123)
```

Easy as `Cmd+C`/`Cmd+V`.

You will then be asked to enter a name for your Captain server aaaand‚Ä¶ you'll be all set!

**That's right! We've just installed CaptainDuckDuck!** ü¶ÜüöÄ

Just so you get the gist, it just took me **15mins to install CaptainDuckDuck** on my server. It's that easy!

You can now access any subdomain to verify that CaptainDuckDuck is running. For example, I visited `helloworld.florimondmanca.com` and was greeted with:

![We just installed CaptainDuckDuck! However, it needs some apps.](/static/img/captainduckduck-blank.png)

Pretty cool!

(I suppose that the fact it reminds me of Heroku's ["There's nothing here yet/Build something amazing"](http://nothinghereyet.herokuapp.com) page is not a coincidence, is it?)

You can now go to your Captain root (in my case, `captain.florimondmanca.com`) and familiarize yourself with the web UI, which has a few sections:

- **Dashboard** is more a home page than anything.
- **Apps** allows you to create and manage apps.
- **Nodes** explains how to configure a Docker Registry to run CaptainDuckDuck on a cluster of nodes.
- **Monitoring** allows you to start a NetData **metrics collector** that will show you live information about your server (incoming requests, CPU and memory usage, etc). It can even send alerts! üö® I've configured it to send alerts to a Telegram bot; that's pretty neat!
- **Settings** is just what you would expect (password reset, etc‚Ä¶) plus the base Nginx configuration and a handy widget to cleanup unused Docker images.

![Sections of the CaptainDuckDuck web UI.](/static/img/captainduckduck-ui-sections.png)

Let's focus on the "Apps" section; this is where most of the CaptainDuckDuck magic takes place.

## Manage apps in the web interface

The "Apps" section of the UI allows you to manage your apps ‚Äî much like you would do on a Cloud provider such as Heroku.

If you open this section, the following form allows you to create a new app.

![Creating new apps is easy with CaptainDuckDuck.](/static/img/captainduckduck-create-app.png)

You just need to provide two things:

- The **name** of the app: an app named `myapp` will be accessible on `myapp.yourdomain.com`.
- And whether it has **persistent data**, i.e. any data you don't want to lose between app restarts. Internally, this is implemented through directory mapping and Docker volumes. You can read more about this in [the docs](https://captainduckduck.com/docs/app-configuration.html#persistent-or-not).

Except for databases, I find it best to use non-persistent apps and store data and files somewhere else. That way, the app can be easily modified or removed without risking data loss. For example, I chose to store uploaded files (mostly photos used for my blog posts) on AWS S3 using the AWS Free Tier.

### **Configuring SSL has never been _that_ easy**

After you create your app, you'll be able to access its management page. First thing you'll want to do: **enable SSL**.

And, oh my ‚Äî do you remember the old days of creating, registering and configuring SSL certificates? I do, and I didn't enjoy it. But‚Ä¶

> With CaptainDuckDuck, enabling SSL is crazy simple: just click "Enable HTTPS". Tada! ‚ú®üîê

You can just as easily redirect all the HTTP traffic to HTTPS. It's just that simple.

![That "Enable HTTPS" button is crying for a click, right?](/static/img/captainduckduck-https.png)

### **Edit Nginx config right in your browser**

I told you ‚Äî CaptainDuckDuck relies on the tools we all use and cherish. Docker and Nginx are two of them.

![The Docker and Nginx logos. Already know 'em? That's the point!](/static/img/captainduckduck-nginx-docker.png)

Let's focus on Nginx here. Each app on CaptainDuckDuck benefits from **its own Nginx configuration file**. And you can edit it _directly in the browser_.

On an app's management page, simply click "Edit default Nginx configuration" and it will display the Nginx configuration CaptainDuckDuck already uses for your app. It contains stuff such as SSL and HTTP/HTTPS redirection.

![In-browser Nginx config. It's rather bare-bones, but it works!](/static/img/captainduckduck-nginx-config.png)

You can [add your own configuration pieces](https://captainduckduck.com/docs/nginx-customization.html) right there. **Just make sure that your Nginx configuration is syntactically correct!** Otherwise, CaptainDuckDuck will crash and you'll have to SSH on your instance and debug on the command line‚Ä¶ True story.

_Yep, that's not great to be honest. But hey, CaptainDuckDuck is still pretty new! There are tons of enhancements every week, so I hope they'll include an Nginx configuration validator soon to prevent you from doing stupid stuff._

As an example, here are the custom bits of configuration I added for my `blog` frontend app under the `server` block listening on port 443:

```nginx
root /nginx-shared/dist;

# Prevent clickjacking attacks by denying iframe integrations
add_header X-Frame-Options DENY;

# Block if browser has disabled XSS protection
add_header X-XSS-Protection "1;mode=block";

# Disable MIME type sniffing
add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff;

index index.html index.htm;

location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
}
```

I add some security headers and redirect all requests to Angular's `index.html` file. Pretty standard Nginx configuration for Angular, but if you're not too familiar with it I really like [this tutorial article](https://medium.com/@jgefroh/a-guide-to-using-nginx-for-static-websites-d96a9d034940) on using Nginx for static websites.

One last thing that I wish I had known earlier ‚Äî **CaptainDuckDuck allows you to share files between the app container and the rest of your server**. More specifically, it mounts `/captain/nginx-shared/` on the server as an app volume at `/nginx-shared/`. This has allowed me to serve a `dist` folder containing Angular compiled static assets from _within_ the `blog` app container. I copy that folder on the server during the CI/CD pipeline, but that's for another blog post entirely!

### **Other honorable mentions**

Quick mention of some other interesting features CaptainDuckDuck provides to manage your apps:

- You can configure **environment variables** directly on the app's management page ‚Äî I used this to configure the API!
- Same goes for **port mappings**, which allow you to map internal ports of your container to external ports (made available to the whole interwebs).

## Some caveats, though

As you can see, CaptainDuckDuck is packed with features to make your life easier. I think it's really a small revolution in the world of open source deployment tools.

However, there are some **caveats** you need to be aware of.

**CaptainDuckDuck is still quite new.** Its initial commit was in October 2017. Although bugs are fixed and features are added on a weekly basis, it could use some tweaks. In particular, the web UI suffers from bugs (although they are purely visual). Also, error handling can be quite loose. I think simply showing a "something went wrong!" message doesn't really empower you, the developer, to try and find the root cause.

As a result, **it is not perfect, nor magical**. Although it does a lot of things for you (such as handling Docker containers and images, providing app templates and databases, configuring SSL, providing a default Nginx configuration‚Ä¶), in the end there will be some times when you mess up and have to SSH on your server for some good ol' debugging.

This is why I recommend having **a basic understanding of how Docker and Nginx work** before you start using CaptainDuckDuck for more advanced deployments. These technologies are growing industry standards (if they're not already), so it's a good investiment anyway. You can start by checking out the [Docker](https://docs.docker.com) and [Nginx](https://docs.nginx.com) documentation. However, getting started with CaptainDuckDuck is really easy, so fear not!

## Skipped: the Captain Definition

After some hesitation, I won't cover the concepts behind the `captain-definition` file as I think it will be quite reminiscent to those of you who are already familiar with writing `Dockerfile`s. Also, [the official docs](https://captainduckduck.com/docs/captain-definition-file.html) are pretty explicit so you should be able to get started quickly. It's a big part of the power behind CaptainDuckDuck, so be sure to check it out!

## Conclusion

We have reached the end of our two-part article about **CaptainDuckDuck**! ü¶Ü

I have tried to convey how excited I am about CaptainDuckDuck. It truly helped me to **relieve the pains of deployment** while **keeping control over my budget and infrastructure**.

Despite its minor imperfections, I believe this is a wonderful piece of open source software with great future. It's definitely worth checking out (head to [the docs](https://captainduckduck.com)!) if you're eager to automate and streamline your web app deployment process. üíª
